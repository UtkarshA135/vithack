# Cert-Maker
An Flutter app to generate E-certificates for GlobalCert under the vithacks

## About the app-
The app is secured with Authentication in form of E-mail and password with a verification link sent to your mail to continue further.
All you need is to drop a .csv file and the app would provide you various templates for the certificates and just with a single click all the certificates will be generated.
You can share these certicates directly through the app in pdf format or barcode format.

## Tech - Stack
- Flutter
- Firebase
## Target Audience
We made it for GlobalCert , but it could be a handy application for all those organizations which conduct competitions and have to distribute E-certificates .
## Future Plans 
Later we also wish to integrate Block Chain and using Smart contract we wish to make it more secure .
